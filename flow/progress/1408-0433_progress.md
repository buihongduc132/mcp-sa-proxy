# Progress Report - 14/08/2025 04:33

## Summary

This report summarizes the work done on the `mcp-sa-proxy` component. The main goal was to bring the component to feature parity with the original `@srbhptl39/mcp-superassistant-proxy` package, with a focus on implementing WebSocket support and improving the overall architecture.

## Initial State

The project was a fork of `@yulin0629/mcp-superassistant-proxy`, which was missing several key features from the original package, including:

*   WebSocket support
*   Session management
*   Advanced configuration options (headers, CORS, health endpoints)
*   Modular architecture

## Completed Tasks

I have completed the following tasks:

1.  **Implemented WebSocket Transport:** I added a `WebSocketServerTransport` class that implements the `Transport` interface from the `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`.
2.  **Added WebSocket Gateway:** I created a `configToWs` gateway that allows running the proxy with a WebSocket endpoint.
3.  **Refactored McpServerManager:** I refactored the `McpServerManager` to be more robust and to support the new modular architecture.
4.  **Implemented Session Management:** I added a `SessionManager` and `SessionAccessCounter` to handle stateful connections for the StreamableHttp gateway.
5.  **Enhanced Configuration:** I verified that the existing configuration options for headers, CORS, and health endpoints are working correctly.
6.  **Updated Dependencies:** I updated the `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` to the latest version.
7.  **Modularized Architecture:** I refactored the project to be more modular by moving the transports and gateways into separate directories and by creating a new `main.ts` file that dynamically loads the gateways.
8.  **Fixed Build Errors:** I fixed all the build errors that arose after updating the SDK.

## Architectural Changes

The project now has a more modular architecture:

*   **`src/transports`:** Contains the transport implementations (e.g., `WebSocketServerTransport`).
*   **`src/gateways`:** Contains the gateway functions that connect the transports.
*   **`src/lib`:** Contains shared libraries and utilities.
*   **`src/main.ts`:** The main entry point of the application, which dynamically loads the gateways based on the command-line arguments.

## Bug Fixes

*   Fixed a duplicate import in `src/index.ts`.
*   Fixed several build errors after updating the `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`.

## Next Steps

The project is now in a good state. The next steps would be to:

*   Add more tests to ensure the stability of the new features.
*   Continue to monitor the original package for any new features and integrate them into this project.
