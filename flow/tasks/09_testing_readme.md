# Task 9: Create Testing README

## Goal

Create a `README.md` file in the `tests` directory to provide clear instructions on how to run the test suite and understand the testing strategy.

## Steps

1.  **Create `tests/README.md`**: This file will be the main documentation for the testing setup.

2.  **Add Sections**:
    - **Overview**: Briefly describe the testing strategy, including the mix of unit and end-to-end tests.
    - **Running Tests**: Provide the command to run the entire test suite (`npm test`).
    - **Unit Tests**: Explain the purpose of the unit tests and where to find them (e.g., `src/**/*.test.ts`).
    - **End-to-End Tests**: Explain the purpose of the E2E tests and how they work, including the use of the mock `stdio` server.
    - **Adding New Tests**: Provide guidelines for adding new tests to the suite.
