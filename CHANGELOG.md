## [Unreleased] - WebSocket Timeout Fix

### Added
- **WebSocket Keep-Alive Mechanism**
  - Implemented ping/pong keep-alive to prevent 30-second timeouts
  - Configurable ping interval via `--wsPingInterval` option (default: 25000ms)
  - Configurable pong timeout via `--wsPongTimeout` option (default: 5000ms)
  - Automatic connection cleanup when pong timeout is exceeded
  - Per-client timeout management with proper resource cleanup

### Fixed
- **Critical**: Fixed WebSocket connections timing out after 30 seconds
  - Added ping/pong mechanism to maintain connection liveness
  - Prevents infrastructure-level timeouts from dropping idle connections
  - Improved connection stability for long-running WebSocket sessions

### Enhanced
- **WebSocket Transport Reliability**
  - Better error handling and connection state management
  - Proper cleanup of ping/pong timers on connection close
  - Enhanced logging for WebSocket connection lifecycle events

## [0.0.19] - 2025-06-08

### Added
- **Parallel Server Initialization**

  - Scales better with large numbers of MCP servers
  - No impact on individual server connection reliability

## [0.0.18] - 2025-06-07

### Added
- **Advanced Concurrent Request Control**
  - Configurable per-session concurrent request limits (default: 10)
  - HTTP 429 responses when concurrent limit exceeded
  - Request lifecycle tracking with automatic counter management
  - New CLI option: `--maxConcurrentRequestsPerSession <number>`

### Enhanced
- **Intelligent Session Management**
  - Extended session timeout from 2 to 5 minutes for better stability
  - Smart activity tracking with `lastActivity` timestamps
  - Safe cleanup mechanism that preserves sessions with active requests
  - Improved session initialization with correct active request counting

### Improved
- **Streamable HTTP Transport Stability**
  - Unified concurrent control across POST, GET, and DELETE endpoints
  - Enhanced error logging with detailed debug information
  - Better request completion tracking in try/finally blocks
  - Consistent session validation across all HTTP methods

### Fixed
- **Session Lifecycle Issues**
  - Session initialization now correctly starts with activeRequests = 1
  - Fixed potential race conditions in concurrent request tracking
  - Improved session cleanup safety checks
  - Better error handling for session termination

### Technical
- **Code Quality Improvements**
  - Comprehensive test coverage with 30 passing tests
  - Enhanced debugging capabilities with detailed request logging
  - Configurable parameters moved from hardcoded to options
  - Memory usage optimization through better session data structure

## [0.0.17] - 2025-06-07

### Fixed
- **Critical**: Fixed SSE sessions not being released when browser tabs are closed
  - Enhanced socket status detection before sending keep-alive
  - Improved cleanup mechanism with socket.destroy() when needed
  - Better detection of dead connections through write failures
- Improved error categorization system (transient vs critical errors)
  - Only cleanup on critical errors or after 5+ accumulated errors
  - Prevents premature disconnection on transient network issues

### Changed
- **Performance Improvements**
  - Reduced keep-alive interval from 30s to 15s for faster dead connection detection
  - Reduced cleanup check interval from 30s to 10s
  - Reduced stale session threshold from 5 minutes to 2 minutes
  - Added 1-minute threshold for dead connection detection
- **Enhanced Connection State Tracking**
  - Added connectionState field (active/closed/error)
  - Added errorCount tracking
  - Added keepAliveSuccess counter
  - Improved session cleanup logging
- **Simplified Implementation**
  - Removed unnecessary SSE retry mechanism
  - Removed unused clientInfo and lastError tracking
  - Removed TCP_NODELAY setting (not beneficial for SSE)

### Improved
- Socket configuration now uses 15s TCP keep-alive probes (was 30s)
- Keep-alive mechanism now checks socket writability before sending
- Cleanup functions now properly destroy underlying sockets
- Better handling of concurrent cleanup events

## [0.0.16] - 2025-06-07

### Added
